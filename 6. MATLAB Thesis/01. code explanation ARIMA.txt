ARIMA Model
This MATLAB code analyzes and forecasts river flow data from 2011 to 2018 using a Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The code includes sections for data preprocessing, transformation, model fitting, forecasting, simulation, and evaluation. It also has versions for 1-week and 1-month intervals.
a. Preprocessing:

Clear command window, workspace, and close figures.
Load and clean data.
Organize data into a 3D array.
Calculate daily averages.
b. Data transformation:

Adjust the data matrix.
Compute weekly averages for 2011-2017 and 2018.
c. Model fitting:

Define ARIMA models with various orders and seasonality.
Fit models and compute performance metrics.
Select the best model based on the lowest BIC value.
d. Forecasting and simulation:

Estimate the best model and forecast river flow for 27 weeks.
Perform a Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 paths and calculate percentiles.
e. Model evaluation:

Compare observed values to percentiles.
Plot predictions, observed values, and their ranges.
Compute additional evaluation metrics and create diagnostic plots.
