Thomas-Fierring Model
This MATLAB code analyzes and predicts river flow data using an autoregressive model.
The code includes sections for data preprocessing, model fitting, and visualization.
It was tested with various time intervals (15 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month).
This is the version for the two week interval version:

a. Data preprocessing:

Clear command window, workspace, and close figures.
Load and clean data.
Organize data into a 3D matrix.
Calculate daily averages.
Adjust the data matrix.
Organize data into another 3D matrix.
Compute means of the matrix along the second dimension.
b. Model fitting and prediction:

Initialize variables and matrices.
Calculate correlations and coefficients for the autoregressive model.
Generate 1000 predictions using the autoregressive model.
Transform predictions back to the original scale.
Calculate percentiles of the predictions.
Handle negative values or values greater than maxQ in predictions.
Fill missing values using linear interpolation.
Calculate the proportion of observed values within specified ranges.
c. Visualization:

Create a plot showing predicted river flow distribution for each 2-week period,
observed river flow values, and the specified predicted percentile ranges compared with the predicted .
