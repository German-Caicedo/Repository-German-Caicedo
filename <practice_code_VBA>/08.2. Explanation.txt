8.	GenerateFibonacciSequence
This VBA script for Excel generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number. The script first initializes variables for the row and column numbers of the cell where the output starts, and clears all cells in the worksheet. It then initializes the first number in the sequence, n, to 1. The script uses a Do Until loop to generate the sequence until the value of n exceeds 56. Within the loop, the script writes the current value of n to the current row and column of the worksheet, and then calculates the next value in the sequence by adding the value of the previous row in the same column. The loop then increments the row number and continues until the condition n > 56 is met. The resulting sequence is written to the worksheet in the specified location.
It includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including n, fila, and columna.
b)	Input/Output: The code outputs the Fibonacci sequence to different cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property.
c)	Looping: The code uses a Do Loop to iterate through the Fibonacci sequence until a specific condition is met.
The algorithm used in this code involves generating the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain point. The code uses a Do Loop to iterate through the sequence and output each number to a different cell in the active worksheet. It starts with the first two numbers (1 and 1) and adds them together to generate the third number, and then adds the second and third numbers to generate the fourth number, and so on, until the loop condition is met (in this case, until the next number in the sequence is greater than 56). The output is a list of the Fibonacci sequence in different cells in the worksheet.
