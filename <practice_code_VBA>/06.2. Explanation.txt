6.	RemoveExtraSpaces
This VBA script for Excel removes extra spaces from a user-inputted phrase. First, it prompts the user to enter a phrase with extra spaces, which is then trimmed to remove any leading or trailing spaces. The phrase is displayed in cell A1. The script then splits the phrase into an array of words and iterates through the array. If a non-empty word is found, it is concatenated to a new string 's' with a single space. The final string 's' with the extra spaces removed is displayed in cell A2.
It includes the following programming concepts:

a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including x, i, y, f, c, and s.
b)	Input/Output: The code prompts the user for input using the InputBox function, and outputs the original input string (after removing extra spaces), and the modified string with only one space between words, to different cells in the active worksheet using the Range property.
c)	String Manipulation: The code uses the Trim function to remove any extra spaces at the beginning and end of the input string, and the Split function to split the string into an array of words. It then uses a loop to concatenate the words back into a string, with only one space between each word.
The algorithm used in this code involves removing any extra spaces at the beginning and end of the input string, splitting the string into an array of words, and concatenating the words back into a string, with only one space between each word. It does this by iterating through the array of words and checking if each word is empty or not. If the word is not empty, it adds it to a string with a single space, and if the word is empty, it skips it. It outputs the original input string and the modified string to the worksheet.
