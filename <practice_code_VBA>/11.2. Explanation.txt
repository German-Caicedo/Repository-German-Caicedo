11.	Namesearch
This VBA code is designed to search for the word "MARIA" in a column adjacent to the active cell, and then extract and list all the cells containing the word "MARIA" in a new column to the right of the active cell.
It includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including f, c, x, i, and y.
b)	Input/Output: The code accesses data from cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property and outputs the result of filtering an array to adjacent cells using the same property.
c)	Arrays: The code uses an array x to store the values of a range of cells in the active worksheet, and an array y to store the results of filtering the x array.
d)	Looping: The code uses a Do Loop to iterate through a range of cells in the active worksheet, and a For Loop to iterate through the elements of the y array.
The algorithm used in this code involves filtering an array x to obtain the values of cells in a range that contain the string "MARIA". The code starts by initializing the variables f and c to the values of the active cell's row and column, respectively, and clears the column immediately to the right of the active cell using the Columns property. It then initializes the variable i to 0 and enters a Do Loop that iterates through a range of cells in the active worksheet, storing the value of each cell in the array x and incrementing the values of f and i by 1 until it reaches an empty cell. The code then initializes the variable f to the value of the active cell's row, and uses the Filter function to create an array y that contains only the elements of x that contain the string "MARIA". Finally, the code uses a For Loop to iterate through the elements of y, outputting each value to an adjacent cell in the worksheet using the Cells property and incrementing the value of f by 1. The output is a list of values from the range of cells that contain the string "MARIA", displayed in adjacent cells in the worksheet.
