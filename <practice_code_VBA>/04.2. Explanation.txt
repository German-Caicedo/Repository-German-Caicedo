4.	PrimeFactorization
This VBA script for Excel calculates the factors of a given positive integer less than 100. It validates the user input to ensure it meets the criteria and then computes the factors by dividing the input number by a range of integers. The resulting factors are displayed in an Excel worksheet.
It includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including z, fila, and a.
b)	Input/Output: The code prompts the user for input using the InputBox function, and outputs messages to the user using the MsgBox function. It also outputs the input value and headers for the output columns to specific cells in the active worksheet using the Range property.
c)	Looping: The code uses a Do Loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until the input meets certain conditions. It also uses a Do Loop to generate a list of numbers from 1 to the input value, and another Do Loop to check each number in the list and output the factors of the input value to the worksheet.
d)	Conditional Statements: The code uses multiple conditional statements (If...Then...Else) to check the input value for various conditions, such as whether it is an integer, within a certain range, and not empty. It also uses a conditional statement (If...Then) to check if a number is a factor of the input value and delete it if it is not.
The algorithm used in this code involves prompting the user for input and checking it for various conditions. It then generates a list of numbers from 1 to the input value, checks each number to see if it is a factor of the input value, and outputs the factors to the worksheet. The factors are obtained by dividing the input value by each number in the list and checking if the result is an integer (i.e., if there is no remainder). Any numbers that are not factors are deleted from the list.
