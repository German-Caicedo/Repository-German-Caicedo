7.	ReverseAlphabetSubstitution
This VBA script for Excel creates a secret message from a user-inputted phrase by replacing each character with its counterpart from a reversed alphabet. The script prompts the user to enter a phrase, which is then displayed in the active cell. The phrase is broken down into individual characters and displayed in a column. The script then generates two arrays, one with the alphabet in ascending order and another with the alphabet in descending order. The script iterates through the inputted phrase's characters, replacing each character with its counterpart from the reversed alphabet. The resulting secret message is displayed in the column next to the reversed alphabet.
This code is also written in VBA and includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including f, c, x, y, i, p, e, k, and v.
b)	Input/Output: The code prompts the user for input using the InputBox function, and outputs the original input string, the letters of the alphabet, their reverse order, the length of the input string, the modified string with letters replaced according to a specific rule, and the final secret phrase, to different cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property.
c)	String Manipulation: The code uses the Mid function to extract each letter in the input string, the Chr function to generate the letters of the alphabet, and the Join function to concatenate the modified letters back into a string.
d)	Looping: The code uses several loops to iterate through each letter in the input string and replace it with a corresponding letter according to a specific rule. It also uses loops to generate the letters of the alphabet and their reverse order.
The algorithm used in this code involves extracting each letter in the input string and replacing it with a corresponding letter according to a specific rule. The rule involves replacing each letter with the corresponding letter in the reverse order of the alphabet. The code first extracts each letter in the input string using the Mid function, and then generates the letters of the alphabet and their reverse order using loops and the Chr function. It then uses a loop to iterate through each letter in the input string and replace it with the corresponding letter according to the rule. It outputs the original input string, the letters of the alphabet and their reverse order, the modified string with letters replaced according to the rule, and the final secret phrase to the worksheet.
