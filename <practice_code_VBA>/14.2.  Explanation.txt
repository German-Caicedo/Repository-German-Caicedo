14.	Even-OddChecker
This VBA script for Excel creates a list of even or odd numbers depending on the values in the cells to the left of the active cell. The script first initializes variables for the row and column numbers of the active cell. Then, using a Do Until loop, it loops through all the cells to the left of the active cell until it encounters an empty cell. For each non-empty cell, the script checks whether the value is even or odd using the Mod operator. If the value is zero, it writes an empty string in the corresponding cell to the right of the active cell. Otherwise, if the value is even, it writes "PAR" in the cell to the right, and if the value is odd, it writes "IMPAR". The script uses variables to keep track of the row number for writing the results in the correct row, and increments the row number after each iteration of the loop.
Itincludes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including z, FILA, and COLUMNA.
b)	Input/Output: The code accesses data from cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property and outputs the result of a series of conditional statements to adjacent cells using the same property.
c)	Conditional Statements: The code uses several If...ElseIf statements to check if a number in a cell is zero or even, and outputs a corresponding result to an adjacent cell.
d)	Looping: The code uses a Do Loop to iterate through a range of cells in the active worksheet.
The algorithm used in this code involves checking the value of each cell in a range and outputting a corresponding result to an adjacent cell. The code starts by initializing the variables FILA and COLUMNA to the values of the active cell's row and column, respectively, and storing the value of the cell to the left of the active cell in the variable z. It then enters a Do Loop that checks the value of each subsequent cell in the range using several If...ElseIf statements, and outputs a corresponding result to an adjacent cell using the Cells property. It then increments the value of FILA by 1 and repeats the process until it reaches a cell with no value to the left of the active cell. The output is a list of results indicating whether each number in the range is zero, even, or odd, in adjacent cells in the worksheet.
