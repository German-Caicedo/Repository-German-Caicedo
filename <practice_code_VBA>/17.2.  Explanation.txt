17.	Sentence Validation
This code is a VBA macro that prompts the user to enter a sentence of at least 4 words using an input box. The entered sentence is then split into an array of words, and the program checks if it has less than four words. If the sentence is valid, it writes it to the current cell position in the worksheet. If the sentence has less than 4 words, the program displays an error message using a message box. The code clears all the cells in the current worksheet, assigns the current row and column numbers to the variables f and c, and uses these variables to write the entered sentence to the cell at the current position. In summary, this code validates and writes a sentence to a specific cell in the worksheet.
It includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including f, c, x, and y.
b)	Input/Output: The code accesses data from the user using an InputBox and outputs messages to the user using a MsgBox. It also writes data to cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property.
c)	Conditional Statements: The code uses several nested If...End If statements to check the number of words in a user input phrase, and outputs a corresponding error message to the user using a MsgBox.
The algorithm used in this code involves checking the number of words in a user input phrase and outputting a corresponding error message if the phrase contains less than 4 words. The code starts by clearing all cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property. It then prompts the user to input a phrase using an InputBox, and stores the phrase in the variable x. The code uses the Split function to split the phrase into individual words and stores them in the array y. It then uses several nested If...End If statements to check the number of words in the phrase and outputs a corresponding error message to the user using a MsgBox. If the phrase contains at least 4 words, it writes the phrase to the active cell using the Cells property.
