9.	PhraseSplitter
This VBA script for Excel prompts the user to input a phrase, then separates the phrase into words and into individual letters. The script uses the Split function to separate the phrase into words and writes each word in a separate cell in the same row as the input cell. Then, the script uses a loop and the Mid function to separate the phrase into individual letters and writes each letter in a separate cell in the same column as the input cell. The separated words and letters are written starting in the cell immediately to the right and to the right of the word column, respectively. The script uses variables to keep track of the row and column numbers for writing the words and letters.
It includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including X, F, C, Y, and Z.
b)	Input/Output: The code prompts the user for input using the InputBox function, and outputs the original input string, the words in the string, and the letters in the string, to different cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property.
c)	String Manipulation: The code uses the Split function to split the input string into an array of words, and the Mid function to extract each letter in the input string.
d)	Looping: The code uses loops to iterate through the array of words and each letter in the input string.
The algorithm used in this code involves separating a sentence into individual words and letters. The code first prompts the user for input using the InputBox function and stores the input string in the variable X. It then splits the input string into an array of words using the Split function and outputs each word to a different cell in the active worksheet using a loop. It also extracts each letter in the input string using the Mid function and outputs each letter to a different cell in the active worksheet using another loop. The output is a list of the words and letters in the input string in different cells in the worksheet.
