15.	Fill_Numbers
This VBA script for Excel creates a list of consecutive numbers from 1 to 10 in the active column and then removes the numbers 3, 4, and 5 from the list. First, the script clears the worksheet and adds a description in cell B2. It then writes the consecutive numbers (1 to 10) in the active column, starting from the active cell's row. Next, the script iterates through the list to find and delete the cells containing 3, 4, or 5. After completing the process, the resulting list will have numbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
It includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including FILA, COLUMNA, and NUMERO.
b)	Input/Output: The code accesses data from cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property and outputs a message to a cell using the same property.
c)	Looping: The code uses a For Loop to iterate through a range of numbers from 1 to 10, excluding 3, 4, and 5, and outputs each number to a separate cell in the worksheet.
The algorithm used in this code involves outputting a list of consecutive numbers from 1 to 10, excluding 3, 4, and 5, to a range of cells in the worksheet. The code starts by initializing the variables FILA and COLUMNA to the values of the active cell's row and column, respectively, and outputs a message to a cell in the worksheet. It then enters a For Loop that iterates through a range of numbers from 1 to 10, excluding 3, 4, and 5, and outputs each number to a separate cell in the worksheet using the Cells property. It then increments the value of FILA by 1 for each number that is outputted and outputs the final value of FILA to a cell in the worksheet. The output is a list of consecutive numbers from 1 to 10, excluding 3, 4, and 5, in separate cells in the worksheet.
