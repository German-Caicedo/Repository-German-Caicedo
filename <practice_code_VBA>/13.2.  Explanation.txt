13.	RomanNumeralConverter
This VBA code converts a Roman numeral in a cell to an integer value. It works by using an array to store the values of Roman numerals I, V, X, L, C, D, and M, and another array to store the corresponding decimal values. It then reads the input Roman numeral from the active cell, maps each numeral to its decimal value, and saves it in a new array. The program then calculates the total decimal value by summing up the values of each numeral and taking into account special cases where a smaller numeral appears before a larger numeral.
It includes the following programming concepts:

a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including x, A, B, C, I, J, S, and F.
b)	Input/Output: The code accesses data from a cell in the active worksheet using the Range property and outputs the result of a series of conditional statements and calculations to another cell using the same property.
c)	Conditional Statements: The code uses several If statements to check the value of each character in a string and assign it a corresponding numerical value based on its Roman numeral representation.
d)	Looping: The code uses two nested For loops to iterate through each character in the string and each value in the arrays A and B, respectively.
e)	Arrays: The code uses arrays A and B to store the Roman numeral characters and their corresponding numerical values, respectively, and array C to store the numerical values of each character in the string.
The algorithm used in this code involves converting a Roman numeral string into its corresponding decimal value. The code starts by initializing the arrays A and B with the Roman numeral characters and their corresponding numerical values, respectively. It then reads a Roman numeral string from cell A1 in the active worksheet and converts each character in the string into its corresponding numerical value using a series of If statements. It stores the numerical values in array C and outputs them to column B in the worksheet. It then sums the values in array C using a loop that checks each value against the next value in the array, and subtracts the value if it is less than the next value or adds it if it is greater than or equal to the next value. The final result is then output to cell A2 in the worksheet.
