16.	EvenOddInputValidation
This VBA script for Excel prompts the user to input a positive integer and then checks if it is indeed an integer and if it is positive. If the input is not valid, the script displays an error message. If the input is valid, the script writes the input in cell B4 and determines if it is even or odd. If it is even, the script writes "par" in cell C4. If it is odd, the script writes "impar" in cell C4. The script uses a loop with conditional statements to check the validity of the user input and perform the appropriate actions.
It includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes a variable z as a string.
b)	Input/Output: The code prompts the user to enter an integer value and stores the result in the variable z using an InputBox function. The code also outputs error messages and results to cells in the active worksheet using the Range property and a series of MsgBox functions.
c)	Conditional Statements: The code uses several If...ElseIf statements to check if the user input is empty, not numeric, not an integer, or not a positive integer, and outputs a corresponding error message to a MsgBox. The code also checks if the input is even or odd using the Mod operator, and outputs a corresponding result to a cell using the Range property.
d)	Looping: The code uses a Do Loop to repeatedly prompt the user to enter a valid integer value until a valid value is entered, or the user cancels the prompt by pressing the Cancel button.
The algorithm used in this code involves prompting the user to enter an integer value using an InputBox function, and then checking if the value is valid using a series of If...ElseIf statements. If the value is valid, the code outputs the value and whether it is even or odd to cells in the worksheet. If the value is invalid, the code outputs an error message to a MsgBox and prompts the user to enter a valid integer value again using a Do Loop, until a valid value is entered or the user cancels the prompt.
