10.	DataTypeIdentifier
This VBA script for Excel analyzes the content of cells in a specific range (rows 5 to 25, column 4) and categorizes them based on their content. For each cell in the range, the script checks if it is empty, a non-numeric string, a positive/negative integer, or a positive/negative decimal. It then writes the corresponding category (e.g., "void", "STRING", "integer,positive", " integer,negative", "decimal,positive", or "decimal,negative") in the adjacent cell (in column 5). The script continues this process for each row in the specified range.
It includes the following programming concepts:
a)	Variables: The code declares and initializes several variables using the Dim statement, including Z, fila, and columna.
b)	Input/Output: The code accesses data from cells in the active worksheet using the Cells property and outputs the result of a series of conditional statements to adjacent cells using the same property.
c)	Conditional Statements: The code uses several If...ElseIf statements to check the value and data type of each cell in a range, and outputs a corresponding result to an adjacent cell.
d)	Looping: The code uses a Do Loop to iterate through a range of cells in the active worksheet.
The algorithm used in this code involves checking the value and data type of each cell in a range, and outputting a corresponding result to an adjacent cell. The code starts by initializing the variables fila and columna to the values of 5 and 4, respectively, and storing the value of the cell at row 5 and column 4 in the variable Z. It then enters a Do Loop that checks the value and data type of each subsequent cell in the range using several If...ElseIf statements, and outputs a corresponding result to an adjacent cell using the Cells property. It then increments the value of fila by 1 and repeats the process until it reaches row 26 and column 4. The output is a list of results indicating whether each cell is empty, a string, a positive or negative integer, or a positive or negative decimal, in adjacent cells in the worksheet.
