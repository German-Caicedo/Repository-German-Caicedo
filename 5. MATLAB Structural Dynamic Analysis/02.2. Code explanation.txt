2.	Seismic Responses
This MATLAB code performs dynamic analysis of a structure subjected to seismic excitation. It first calculates the stiffness matrix of the structure using the element stiffness matrices and transformation matrices. Then, it solves for the displacement, velocity, and acceleration response of the structure using the Newmark-beta method. Finally, it plots the response of the structure in terms of displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
This code performs a seismic analysis that calculates the condensation of a structure under the effect of an earthquake. The code takes a time history acceleration record as input and calculates the response of the structure in terms of acceleration, velocity, and displacement.
The code first reads the acceleration record from a file and converts it into a vector. It then defines the properties of the structure, such as the modulus of elasticity, the moment of inertia, the cross-sectional area, and the length of each element. It creates the stiffness matrix for each element and assembles them into a global stiffness matrix. Then, it calculates the condensation of the structure and uses it to calculate the response of the structure.
The response of the structure is calculated using the Newmark method, which is a numerical method that allows for the calculation of the response of a structure to an arbitrary input. The Newmark method calculates the velocity and displacement of the structure based on the acceleration input, and then iteratively adjusts the acceleration input until the velocity and displacement converge to a solution. The Newmark method is applied to each time step of the acceleration record to calculate the corresponding response of the structure in terms of acceleration, velocity, and displacement.
Finally, the code calculates the elastic spectra of acceleration and pseudo-acceleration, and compares them to the NEC (New Earthquake Criteria) spectrum. The elastic spectra are calculated using the maximum acceleration response of the structure for different values of the period. The pseudo-acceleration is calculated by multiplying the elastic spectra of acceleration by the square of the angular frequency.
