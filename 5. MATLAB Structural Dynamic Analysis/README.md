The first project, "Seismic Response Analysis using Newmark-Beta and NEC Methods," performs seismic response analysis of a structure using the Newmark-beta method and the NEC method. It calculates the maximum displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the structure and provides information about the seismic performance of the structure.

The second project, "Seismic Responses," performs dynamic analysis of a structure under the effect of an earthquake. It calculates the stiffness matrix of the structure, solves for the displacement, velocity, and acceleration response using the Newmark-beta method, and plots the response of the structure. The code also calculates the elastic spectra of acceleration and pseudo-acceleration and compares them to the NEC spectrum.

The third project, "NumericalSimulation_SeismicResponse_FrameBuilding," performs a structural analysis of a building subjected to seismic excitation. It imports acceleration records from an external file, models the building as a six-story frame structure, calculates the structural response of the building using the finite element method, and plots the acceleration, velocity, and displacement time histories of the building.

The fourth project, "EigValues&ForceCalculation," provides a way to simulate the response of a multi-story building to an earthquake and calculate the forces and displacements experienced by the structure. It performs eigenvalue analysis on the stiffness and mass matrices, calculates the seismic response of the structure, and plots the distribution of forces along the height of the structure.
