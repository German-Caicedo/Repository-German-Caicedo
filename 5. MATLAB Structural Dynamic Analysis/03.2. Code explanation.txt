3.	NumericalSimulation_SeismicResponse_FrameBuilding
This is a MATLAB code that performs a structural analysis of a building subjected to seismic excitation. The code first imports acceleration records from an external file (aceleraciones.txt) and converts them into a vector. The building structure is modelled as a six-story frame structure with column and beam elements. The code then calculates the structural response of the building under the seismic excitation, using the finite element method. Next, the code plots the acceleration, velocity, and displacement time histories of the building, as well as the elastic acceleration and velocity spectra, and compares them to the NEC (New Earthquake Code) spectrum.
The code is divided into several sections, each of which performs a specific task:
The first section clears the workspace, imports the acceleration records, and defines the structural properties of the building (material properties, cross-sectional areas, etc.).
The second section creates the element stiffness matrices for each column and beam element of the building and assembles them into the overall stiffness matrix of the building.
The third section solves for the structural response of the building by performing numerical integration of the equations of motion using the Newmark-beta method. The acceleration, velocity, and displacement time histories of the building are then plotted.
The fourth section calculates the elastic acceleration and velocity spectra of the building using the pseudospectral acceleration and velocity methods, respectively. These spectra are then compared to the NEC spectrum.
