1.	 Seismic Response Analysis using Newmark-Beta and NEC Methods.
This code performs seismic response analysis of a structure using the Newmark-beta method and the NEC method to obtain the maximum displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the structure subjected to seismic loading. The code also calculates the pseudo-spectral acceleration and elastic spectral acceleration.
The code starts by clearing the workspace, closing all figures, and loading a seismic record from a file named 'Sgsismo.txt'. The seismic record is processed by transposing it and reshaping it into a single column vector with its corresponding time values in the first column.
A loop is then initiated, which iteratively calculates the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the structure for different periods of the structure using the Newmark-beta method. The maximum values of displacement, velocity, and acceleration for each period are stored.
The pseudo-spectral acceleration and elastic spectral acceleration are then calculated using the maximum acceleration values obtained for each period of the structure and the NEC method.
The code then plots the results of the analysis in several figures. Figure 1 shows the displacement spectrum, the velocity spectrum, and the pseudo-spectral velocity spectrum. Figure 2 shows the acceleration spectrum, the pseudo-spectral acceleration spectrum, and the elastic spectral acceleration spectrum. Figure 3 shows all three acceleration spectra together for comparison.
The results of the analysis provide information about the seismic performance of the structure, which can be used to evaluate the seismic hazard and design the structure to withstand seismic loading.
