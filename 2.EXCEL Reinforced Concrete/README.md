Overview of Civil Engineering Projects:

Interaction Diagram for Rectangular Columns:
This project presents an Excel workbook used to calculate the interaction diagram of a rectangular reinforced concrete column. It assists engineers in determining if a column can withstand axial loads and bending moments without failing. The workbook includes several sheets, inputs for specifying column properties, and detailed calculations to comply with the ACI code 318-14. Please note that most of the instructions are in Spanish.

Interaction Diagram for Circular Columns:
This project involves an Excel workbook that calculates the interaction diagram of a circular reinforced concrete column, helping engineers to ensure the column's ability to withstand axial loads and bending moments without failure. Similar to the rectangular column workbook, it includes multiple sheets, inputs for specifying column properties, and calculations to comply with the ACI code 318-14. Most instructions are in Spanish.

Development Length of Longitudinal Reinforcement:
This project features an Excel sheet designed to calculate the development length of longitudinal reinforcement, ensuring the strength and safety of reinforced concrete structures according to the ACI 318-14 code. Users can input key parameters, and the sheet calculates the straight or hooked development lengths to transfer loads efficiently and safely into the concrete.

Rebar Combination Calculation for Existing Beam Cross-Section:
This Excel sheet calculates different combinations of rebar for an existing beam cross-section with a corresponding ultimate moment, in compliance with the ACI code 318-14. Users input essential parameters, and the sheet calculates the needed steel cross-sectional area and provides suitable options for steel bars. It also includes a checker for spacing compliance according to the code. Note that the inputs are labeled in Spanish.
