Overview of MATLAB Code: 
This MATLAB code analyzes structures with beams of variable cross-sections, computing reactions, displacements, and rotations at the nodes. The original beam is approximated by dividing it into equivalent prismatic beams of equal length with uniform cross-sections. The code calculates values for the original structure and iterates through different discretizations, comparing the results with the original variable cross-section beam. The main steps include loading data, calculating beam properties, assembling stiffness matrices, and solving for nodal displacements and reactions. The input files and the code itself is not numbered as the other files since it creates an error within the matlab code if those are changed.
