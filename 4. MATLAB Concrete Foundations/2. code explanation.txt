This MATLAB code calculates and plots the working stress of nodes in a
 combined footing based on the imported displacements from the text file 
def_zapcomb_H65cm.txt. It clears the workspace, defines
 variables B (soil stiffness factor), qa (admissible stress of the soil), 
and h (footing thickness). The displacements are multiplied by the soil 
stiffness factor B to calculate working stress at each node. Then, it determines
 which nodes exceed the admissible stress and calculates the percentage of nodes
 exceeding this value. The code plots the working stress of each node, alongside the 
admissible stress as a reference, and includes the footing thickness and the percentage
 of nodes exceeding the admissible stress in the legend.
