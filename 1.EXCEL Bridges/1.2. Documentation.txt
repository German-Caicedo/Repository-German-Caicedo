Title: Bridge Abutment Design and Reinforcement Calculation Documentation

Introduction:
This document explains the Excel sheet used to calculate bridge abutment dimensions and steel reinforcements based on various inputs. The calculations are based on experimental observations and recommendations from the AASHTO design code for bridges.

Inputs:

Height of the abutment
Length of the base (to iterate)
Width of stem
Width of base
Length of stem
Length of base
Number of longitudinal beams
Width of the superstructure
Number of vehicular lanes
Weight of the design truck or tandem
Height of the front fill
Concrete density
Soil fill density
Soil friction angle
Inclination of the wall
Inclination of the soil fill
Soil-surface roughness
Vertical loads on the superstructure and horizontal loads
Load increase coefficients
Overload due to traffic
Breaking force
Calculation Steps:

Resistance to Overturning:
Calculate the resistance to overturning of the abutment based on the moments taken from a critical point on the base.

Bearing Resistance:
Evaluate the bearing resistance of the soil, considering the weight of the structure and the additional forces.

Resistance to Sliding:
Calculate the resistance to sliding with and without earthquake, taking into account stabilizing and de-stabilizing forces.

Vertical Reinforcement:
Calculate the reinforcing steel that will resist the moment that comes perpendicular to the plane for the stem, heel slab, and toe slab.

Horizontal Reinforcement:
Determine if the horizontal length of the abutment in the plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the road is adequate and calculate the required reinforcement.

Minimum Steel (Shrinkage Steel):
Calculate the minimum steel required for shrinkage.

Shear Resisting Steel:
Calculate the shear resisting steel required.

In the Excel sheet, there are screenshots of the AASHTO code that provide valuable insights and explanations of how the researchers obtained the formulas used for this particular design problem.

Note: This is a brief summary of the process. In practice, each step involves specific calculations and adjustments based on the unique conditions of the project.
