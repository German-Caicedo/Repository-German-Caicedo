Overview of the Projects:

Bridge Abutment Design and Reinforcement Calculation Documentation:
This project focuses on designing a bridge abutment and calculating its dimensions and steel reinforcements using an Excel sheet based on the AASHTO design code. The process involves determining the resistance to overturning, bearing resistance, resistance to sliding, and calculating the vertical, horizontal, minimum (shrinkage), and shear resisting steel reinforcements. The Excel sheet also includes screenshots of the AASHTO code, providing valuable insights and explanations.

Beam Design and Reinforcement Calculation Documentation:
In this project, an Excel book is utilized to calculate dimensions and steel reinforcements for the longitudinal beams of a small concrete bridge following the AASHTO design code. The book contains five sheets for moment calculations, interior and exterior beam cross-section design, and interior and exterior beam shear reinforcement design. Screenshots of the AASHTO code are also included, offering valuable insights and explanations.

Bridge Slab Design and Reinforcement Calculation Documentation:
This project involves the design and reinforcement calculations of a bridge slab using an Excel sheet based on the AASHTO design code. The process is divided into three parts: moments and weight of the structure, positive and negative bending moment steel, and steel design. The Excel book contains inputs and calculations for each section, as well as citations for the corresponding sections used in each line. The density of concrete is assumed to be 2.4 ton/m3 throughout the calculations.
